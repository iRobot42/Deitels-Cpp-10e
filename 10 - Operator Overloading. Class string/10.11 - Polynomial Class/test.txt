Enter polynomials (10 numbers): 1 1 5 0 -1 2 0 0 3 -1

p1 is +x
p2 is +5-x^2+3x^-1

Size of p2 is 3

p3 is +5-x^2+3x^-1
After p3 = p1, p3 is +x

p1 + p2 = +x+5-x^2+3x^-1
p1 - p2 = +x-5+x^2-3x^-1
p1 * p2 = +5x-x^3+3

After p3 += p1, p3 is +2x
After p3 -= p2, p3 is +2x-5+x^2-3x^-1
After p3 *= p1, p3 is +2x^2-5x+x^3-3
